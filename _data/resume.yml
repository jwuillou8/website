    summary: "At Interscript, I developed a solution to deliver transliteration with generative models.
    First, diacritization models were trained in arabic and hebrew, resp. reproducing and beating existing benchmarks.
    Next, I have designed a new approach to transliteration allowing language experts 
    to design the necessary complex transliteration rules. 
    Data and models are then built and trained via a semi automatised strategy that  
    was presented on a conference to experts."
