caption: Implementation of statistical finance onto polls to extrapolate probabilities of DEM or REP to win the 2020 US elections (Fry--Burke, Taleb)    
description: >
   classical ML fail at modelling US elections accurately. Statistical finance provides with alternatives to evaluate probabilities from polls  (Fry--Burke, Taleb). We have implemented the aforementionned models but also fine tuned them to produce predictions for the 2020 US elections. On that instance, our model predicted correctly that Trump and Biden would be closer than what was widely advertised in the news.

classical approaches combining ML+big data fail at modelling US elections accurately. Statistical finance provides with alternatives to evaluate probabilities from polls  (Fry--Burke, Taleb). 

We have implemented the aforementionned models but also fine tuned them to produce predictions for the 2020 US elections. 

On that instance, our model predicted correctly that Trump and Biden would be closer than what was widely advertised in the news.
