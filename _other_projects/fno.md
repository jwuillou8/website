# FNO for NLP

#### Questions

1. Can language be described as a continuous process? 
2. Can we build transformer with better scaling properties by transforming text data into the Fourier Space?

#### Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)

Fourier Neural Operator is a recent technique described for instance in [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08895.pdf)


#### Work

I am working on porting a technology developed for fluid dynamics and image processing 
into the text processing domain, as FNO scaling properties could be a game changer.

I view the work also as a practical investigation of the nature of Language.

After having proven that these architecture can learn text, I am working on architecture improvements and benchmarking.
