# Plex AI

With Markus Thora, a german entrepreneur, 
we have built IVA, an innovative agent allowing to interact with a website via speech.

The app was combining standard technologies like IOS speech2text, text2speech, language models including entities recognition with a 
chatbot brain encoding chat sequences with sparse distributed memories.

The collaboration was stopped after no customer could be acquired, despite a genuine innovation and a working engine, as demonstrated by successful demos.
