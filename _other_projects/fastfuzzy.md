In order to deal with real world data sparsness and messiness, many real world search engines require
* High speed
* Simple, flexible data modelling 
* Fuzzy search with an intuitive scores
* No false negative 

Mixing high dimensional computing with symbolic logic, one can deliver elegant solutions to 
the above requirements by modelling and encoding datasets as sparse binary vectors. 
Because computations are base on the simplest possible data structures, 
such an engines allows to perform fuzzy searches
at impressive speed and compression rate.

Past and present applications included GPS processing, behavioural and medical data.
