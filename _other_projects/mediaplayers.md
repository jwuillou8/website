  Work as Lead Data Scientist and Engineer at MP, a data driven marketing company.
#   I have developed a generic library transforming multiple data types into Sparse Distributed Memories (binary high dimensional vectors). Code became semantic engine.
#embeddings for utterances and sequences of utterances.
#   classical ML fail at modelling US elections accurately. Statistical finance provides with alternatives to evaluate probabilities from polls  (Fry--Burke, Taleb). We have implemented the aforementionned models but also fine tuned them to produce predictions for the 2020 US elections. On that instance, our model predicted correctly that Trump and Biden would be closer than what was widely advertised in the news.

Mediaplayers is a London based Marketing agency ran by the team behind Cambridge Analytica.

I have helped MP as a consultant on Data Science, but also on the technical/Data engineering side.
MP can now handle half a billion of record/day within 3h of compute on a single core.

I have also designed behavioural simulations (mixing MC sampling with HD computing) to test campaigns taggings and various reinforcement 
learning alorithms.
