# Humbaba

#### Vision

1. Anybody should be able to design software by drawing graphs of components described in natural language.
2. Smart software should be built as union of conversational agents.

#### Technology

**Humbaba II** is leveraging several techniques and technologies to design software as 
a union of conversational agent. 

Advanced language models can be used to create conversational interfaces around sotware components as well as to design automatically software components (writing codes, tests and automatically debugging the whole solution using it).
