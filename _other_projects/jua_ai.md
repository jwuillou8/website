# JUA AI

Jua is introducing deep learning into the weather model market and applications: [jua website](https://www.jua.ai/)



### My Work

* Literature review and models prototyping and testing (graph, Fourier Neural Operator NNets and GAN's)
* Data engineering and modelling
* Model training on distributed GPU's (~40 TB). 

### Production
Model is ran at unseen resolution: 1x1km global / 48 hours / 5 minute timesteps

### Publication
A publication where I am second author is currently under review in American Meteorological Society.
