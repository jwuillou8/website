**Humbaba** is an agent capable of binding multiple services (interfaces or agents) learning their logic by one shot learning (or via single examples). 
It is designed to scale up as "system of systems", allowing for flexibility
and to build complex engines.

There is no need anymore to hardcore complex and opaque rules, 
as these communicate with a simple, human understandable language
 that can be designed and visualised via a simple graphical editor.

The technology has been demonstrated on several business cases. 
The project state is an advanced prototype and two front ends+one API are available.
