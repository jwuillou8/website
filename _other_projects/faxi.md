At faxi, I worked mainly on real time carpooling recommendations and community monitoring.
Community monitoring is using an optimisation algorithm written in julia (JuMP).

In order to fasten and allow for fuzzy computation, I have binarised GPS using a mix of High Dimensional Computing with SDR's and coarse coding. 

Faxi also asked me to study the impact of [carpooling on covid diffusion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-YbDpaBvvR0C3ttNF9hTc4oQN_IsAxPR/view?usp=sharing), which is a document generated from zero within just 4 days.
