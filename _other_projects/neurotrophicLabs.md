# Neurotrophic Labs

With Jeremy Martinez, a californian MD, 
we have called neurotrophic Labs a collaboration aiming at
developing innovative solutions for MD's.

NL is a flexible technological solution helping MDâ€™s to take data based decisions in real time.
With this, we hope to impact positively on individuals health and finance.

## Presentation

One can consult our 2 pagers [summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWWtoDk1NdiUYRz1e8u3qKBy3sjOx9l1/view?usp=sharing).

## App:

We have built a prototype processing 5 millions patient histories from the medicare research dataset. 
This architecture demonstrates that MDs can model simple scenarios and get basic correlations and insights from real data,  very quickly.

One can be play with the [app](http://neurotrophic-labs-live-system.herokuapp.com/).
Live computations are off for security reasons.
