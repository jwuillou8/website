# Work & Interests

## Software as "Union of conversational Agents"

Since several years, I have been working on the idea of automation using 
conversational layers around software components. 

Aside of the fun and elegant design, there are the need to allow 
people with little experience in software engineering to design software
and the need to design smart system to allow for an interesting and smart interaction...

My work is the design of:
* conversational interfaces
* graphical design of software (with simple technologies like lucidchart, etc...)
* software design automation combining the above ideas with advanced language models

## Advanced Neural Networks Architectures

I am interested in applications of Fourier Neural Networks, Graphical Neural Networks, Neuro Inspired Architectures to language and other problems. Some of this is featured in  the /Projects section of this website.

Goal is to run own experiments as well as keeping updated with latest developments.


## High Dimensional Computing

Learning and computations can be accelerated using sparse binary vectors and also, in a nutshell:
- We can combine semantic vectors with symbolic algebra 
- Simpler operations mean compression and more efficient compute

#### Past Work
- **fast fuzzy search** within large datasets was developed and proven on behavioural, medical and GPS datasets
- **AI systems learning via one shot learning**. Unique feature is the ability to perform super fast unsupervised learning of any, multidimensional sequences from multidimensional datasets 
- **Efficient Learning** in term of scores and energy.  
Here we are interested in binary deep learning architectures, preprocessings via sparse vectors and computer architectures optimised for sparse binary computations.
