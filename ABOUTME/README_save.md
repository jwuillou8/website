# About Me

Throughout my life, I have been interested in nature, thinking and languages.
The way I need to approach things is through practical and ambitious realisations in which I like to collaborate. 

So from being a postdoc in numerical physics, a banker for a short while and after the collaboration with multiple startups and companies, I have developed several innovative systems and models and became a AI researcher and engineer. 


This journey gave birth to 
* 12 co-publications in numerical particle physics, working on my own and with medium size collaborations 
* early collaborations with 5 among the best financed startups (>5 millions $, first data engineer in 3 projects)
* the co-foundation of 3 companies (TaxiQ, Plex AI, Neurotrophic Labs) where with a tiny budget, I have led a team of up to 8 people
* several innovative technologies (humbaba, rababa, diacritization,
transliteration learner from graph, ...) 
* over 10 documents in blogs, white papers, paper format (latex) featuring among others a recent publication (2023) of the most accurate precipitation weather model
