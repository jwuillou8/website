Machine & Deep Learning and High Dimensional computing have very distinct qualities and advantages. 

In my work, I am interested in comparisons and integration of the
 aforementioned technologies.

My work includes binary neural networks, binary embeddings and application of these 
strategies onto various datasets.

As an example,  in many cases, I have found that classification scores could be improved
preprocessing the data with HD computing.
