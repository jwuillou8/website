Some of the work is described below or in **Projects**."},{"company":"JUA AI","position":"Lead AI Engineer","startDate":"May 2022","endDate":"Mar 2023","summary":"I was invited by JUA.AI to build advanced weather models using deep learning. Starting from a blue sky project, within 6 months, I could identify, test, train and integrate models and data architecture components that became the core of currently the best weather model predictions on the market."},{"company":"Interscript","position":"AI Engineer","startDate":"Sep 2021","endDate":"Jun 2022","summary":"At Interscript, I developed a solution to deliver transliteration with generative models. First, diacritization models were trained in arabic and hebrew, resp. reproducing and beating existing benchmarks. Next, I have designed a new approach to transliteration allowing language experts to design the necessary complex transliteration rules. Data and models are then built and trained via a semi automatised strategy that was presented on a conference to experts."},{"company":"Neurotrophic Labs","position":"Co-Founder","startDate":"Jun 2019","endDate":"Aug 2021","summary":"Together with a MD as a cofounder, we have developed an app for the US market allowing practitioner to easily model patient states and diseases and retrieve statistical evidences in real time via fuzzy search throughout the US healthcare dataset. The app's focus on speed allows running medical scenarios and test hypotheses in real time."},{"company":"Plex AI","position":"Co-Founder","startDate":"April 2019","endDate":"Aug 2021","summary":"Plex AI vision: interaction with websites via language. My main contribution was building of an iOS app, the agent, the design of a neuro inspired architecture to compress the conversational logic and to run successful demos to potential customers."},{"company":"MediaPlayers","position":"Lead Data Scientist","startDate":"Feb 2020","endDate":"Dec 2020","summary":"I was invited at Mediaplayers to develop their data strategy. I built a data pipeline processing within 3 hours ~1 billion of daily behavioural data points."},{"company":"Faxi (now kinto join)","position":"Senior Data Scientist","startDate":"May 2019","endDate":"Mar 2020","summary":"For faxi, I built new GPS processing and carpooling recommendation algorithms. Thanks to an app that I created, communities can now easily visualise the carpoolings and their benefits in term of money saved and CO2 emissions."},{"company":"Constellation AI","position":"Senior Data Scientist","startDate":"Feb 2018","endDate":"Feb 2019","summary":"I joined the company to build new language models using advantages of sparse representations. After 3 months, I developed a working model to encode and compress text that became the semantic engine after 6 months. This model was extended and tested on several business cases. The model proved to exceed some existing benchmarks, which we have documented in a paper."},{"company":"TaxiQ","position":"Founder","startDate":"Aug 2015","endDate":"Jan 2018","summary":"At TaxiQ we created an app based on collaborative system helping cab drivers in UK to navigate within the city by solving the problem of evaluating the latest waiting times on the taxi ranks. As a CEO, I have managed to put together a team of up to 8 people and to build a MVP (web apps) with a small budget. Along with R&D and development, I developed the business plan and was pitching to potential investors and competitions."},{"company":"Deutsche Bank","position":"Model Validation","startDate":"Feb 2012","endDate":"May 2014","summary":"At DB, I worked on the validation of financial models and implementations on the C++ pricing libraries."},{"company":"Institute for Theoretical Physics","position":"Postdoctoral Researcher","startDate":"Nov 2009","endDate":"Dec 2011","summary":"I was working on QCD and Supersymmetry simulations.
