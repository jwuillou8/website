**Humbaba** is an agent capable of binding multiple services (interfaces or agents) learning their logic by one shot learning (or via single examples). 

This means that one do not need to be programmer to build complex logics, as this can be done via a simple graphical editor.
As explained in the slides, **Humbaba** scales up as "brain of brains".

A MVP is live, contact me for more info or to build a solution.
